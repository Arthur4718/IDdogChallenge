# IDdogChallenge
App created as a challenge from IDwall hiring team. 


This app showcases a list of images to users that can login with a valid e-mail. I will describe some of the libraries that i used
during development, and also showcasing some examples if you want to get your feet wet with some popular libraries. 


# Libraries Used 

In order to perform all the actions listed above, i used:

Glidev4 - To list and cache images on disk. 
RecyclerView - List and recycle images on the user display.
Looopj Asynchronous Http Client - A library based on Apache. 
MVC pattenrs - In order to better organize and separate View Actions from Data Actions.


# Glidev4 implementation and usage. 

In the Gradle.App document, i added the following implementations. 

'''Java
  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.7.1'
  // Glide v4 uses this new annotation processor -- see https://bumptech.github.io/glide/doc/generatedapi.html
    annotationProcessor 'com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.7.1'
'''
